This folder stores parameters for RNA Suite Potential.
The potential is based on a Gaussian mixture model in 7D space.

Each folder contains two files.

center.txt: Centers and weights for mixture components. The first number is
the weight of the component (default to 1). The following numbers are the
angles for the mixture center in 7D space, in the order of (delta-1, epsilon-1,
zeta-1, alpha, beta, gamma, delta), which is detailed in the Richarson's
suite definition.

inv_cov.txt: The inverse of the covariance matrix of the Gaussian mixtures.
Here we assumes all mixture components have the same underlying covariance,
so there is only one file. The inverse matrix is stored to facilitate
compuation.

###### Description of each parameter set ######
Richardson: The parameters from the original Richardson et al. 2008 RNA paper.
The data has 53 centers (including the wanna-be suites).
The suite half-width is converted to standard deviation using
`sigma = hw * 0.1898` to conform to the same shape as other potential parameter.
Note that the covariance is diagonal, because the Richardson's build their
model based on such diagonal approximation.

Richardson_refit: This parameter is similar to the "Richardson" parameter.
It is based on the suite assignment of Richardson's suites. However the
cluster centers and the covariance are refitted with the current PDB data.

Denovo_60: Parameter generated by EM-based Gaussian Mixture model fitted to
the entire PDB torsions. The number of components is set to 60.
