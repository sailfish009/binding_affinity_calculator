# Properties of paramagnetic spin-label residues.
#
# Author: Georg.Kuenze@vanderbilt.edu
#
# Notes:
# This file contains properties for the following spin-label residues:
# R1A, CED, C2X, C3X, C4X, NTA.
# Add properties of any new spin-label to this list, in addition to the
# spin-label residue type params file. The fields "Key", "Chemical_Name",
# "Three_Letter_Code", "One_Letter_Code" and "Radical_Atom" are mandatory.
# The remaining fields are optional and should be labeled "N/A" if not present.
# They have the following meaning:
# A distance potential histogram file is needed for conversion of PRE distances
# into CB-CB atom pair constraints and is used as histogram for the Spline
# constraints function. The histogram file should contain two lines: the first
# line contains the x-values, the second line the y-values. Values must be TAB
# separated and in ascending order. The bin size must be 0.5. It is further
# assumed that the values return to the base line at the edge of the given x-axis
# value range. If the spin-label is going to be used with the PREEnergy scoring
# method a file containing the PDB rotamers of this spin-label must be added to
# the database and its path must be included in this table.
