# These weights are for discriminating native complexes from decoys
# for small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions.

# These weights were developed as described in the publication:
# "Enhancements to the Rosetta energy function enable improved identfication
#    of small-molecules that inhibit protein-protein interactions"
# Kelow, Bazzoli, and Karanicolas (submitted)


# The reference weights here are not meaningful.
# These weights are for scoring only, NOT anything where the structure moves.
