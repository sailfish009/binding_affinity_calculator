# This weight set was generated with all of the talaris2013 improvements
# except for the 2010 rotamer library.  The reference energies here
# were fit with the 2002 rotamer library.  That is, the score function
# improvements (over score12) that it contains are:
#
# the sp2 hydrogen bond potential, an explicit electrostatics term with a
# distance dependent dielectric (and a removal of the previous knowledge-
# based electrostatic potential, fa_pair), an adjustment to the LK_DGFREE
# parameters for four atom types, the 05.2009 ideal coordinates for
# the amino acids, an expansion of hydroxyl sampling for serine and
# threonine, the use of bicubic-spline interpolation in our knowledge-
# based potentials, an improved disulfide potential, and an analytic
# evaluation of our Lennard-Jones and EEF1 potentials.
#
# If you need to use this weight set, then use these flags on your command line:
# -dun10 false
# -score:weights talaris2013_dun02.wts
#
# Where the second flag (-score:weights) may not be neccessary if you're using
# RosettaScripts and have specified your score function from an XML file.
#
# Reference energies were fit with optE on Jane Richardson's HiQ54 benchmark
# set in triplicate, and tested on the Ding & Dokholyan 38 set.  The
# set of reference energies with the highest sequence recovery (39.6%) was
# chosen.
