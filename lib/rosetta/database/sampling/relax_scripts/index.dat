#This file organizes the available relax scripts.
#Each script lists whether or not (Y/N) it has specific implementations based on the score function in the second column
#If so, the third column contains a :-delimited list of score functions with implementations.
#Note: for a score funciton to have an implementation, there must be a file "A.B.txt" where A is the title and B is the name of the scorefunction.
#      Ideally, there will also be an "A.B.dualspace.txt" file.
