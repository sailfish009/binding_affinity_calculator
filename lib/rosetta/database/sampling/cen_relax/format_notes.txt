Format for Controlling Centroid Relax parameters:

Columns: vdw_ramp rama_ramp min_tol cst_ramp

Must give values for each column in each row.  If ramping, the number of ramps will increase with the number of row.  
Note that the default parameters are adopted from the FastRelax application by Mike Tyka.
