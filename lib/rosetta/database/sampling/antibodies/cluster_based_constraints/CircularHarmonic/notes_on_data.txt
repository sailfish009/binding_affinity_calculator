Data used to create constraints based on an SQLITE3 antibody database of the PDB from June 2012 and Nov 2014.


All data based on:

2.8 A res cutoff
.3 R factor cutoff
Non-Redundant by sequence of CDRs per CHAIN
-CDRs thrown out if a chain did not have all three CDRS!

Reduncancy by:
  ->Lowest Resolution
   ->Lowest R
    ->Highest Chain Length

1) original includes outliers and the standard deviation is off by a few degrees.  Means are the means of the cluster. Created June 2012

2) __outliers_true Created Nov 2014 on updated antibody database.  Means are the center cluster member.  If no center, means were used.  Standard deviations were corrected.

3) outliers_false_liberal Nov 2014 on updated antibody database.  Same as 2, except outliers are left out.  An outlier using the liberal definition is any structure with > 40 DistDegree to cluster center AND a CDR BB heavy RMSD to the cluster center > 1.5 Angstroms.
