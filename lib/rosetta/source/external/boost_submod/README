Overview
========

Each subdirectory (except for boost/) in this directory is a submodule of boost (See https://github.com/boostorg/boost/ for the superproject.)
See the submodule.txt for a list of the current submodules, and for any notes as to why they're included.

The boost/ directory itself is not a submodule, but instead a collection of symlinks into the submodule contents.

Initial cloning
--------------

    git submodule add git@github.com:boostorg/${r}.git source/external/boost_submod/${r}

or 

    for r in `grep -v '^#' source/external/boost_submod/submodules.txt`; do
        git submodule add git@github.com:boostorg/${r}.git source/external/boost_submod/${r}
	sleep 5 # Rate limiting
    done

Note that GitHub apparently doesn't like rapid submodule additions under ssh, so you need some sort of rate limiting in the automated process to keep from dying partway through
(And it's really difficult to recover from dying when doing a git submodule add.)
Using HTTPS instead for the cloning looks to do better -- we've converted to https.

To update all the submodules to a particular revision
----------------------------------------------------- 

    TAG=boost-1.71.0
    
    for d in */; do
        pushd $d
	echo "===================" $d
	git fetch; git fetch --tags
        git checkout $TAG
	sleep 5 # Rate limiting
        popd
    done

# Be careful about the results. On my machine after a while I get a bunch of ssh errors. 
# It might be related to rate limiting on Githubs end - you might want to add some sort of rate limter (as sleep statement) within the loop.
# Though it looks like using HTTPS avoids that issue.

# NOTE: Some submodules have Rosetta-specific additions/alterations.
# You'll need to update them accordingly.
# Generally, you'll need to merge in the "Rosetta" branch with the new version of the repo.
# Take a look at the .gitmodules files for the list of the submodules which were forked for Rosetta-specific modifications.

MODULES WITH MODIFICATIONS:
---------------------------

* multi_index 
    * Alterations to the buckets on the bucket array for PyRosetta
* integer
    * Disable some templates for PyRosetta
* lexical_cast
    * Disable compile time checking for PyRosetta (specifically for the PYROSETTA_DISABLE_LCAST_COMPILE_TIME_CHECK define.)


To update the boost/ directory symlinks
---------------------------------------

This should be done after any major update to the submodules.

    ./update_boost_links.sh

The changes in the symlinks in the source/external/boost_submod/boost/ should be committed to the repo.
